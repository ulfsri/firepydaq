## FIREpyDAQ v0.1.1
- Path for saving data changed for a text input to file name for improved clarity. Now, for a text input to file name, a directory `02_ExperimentData` or `01_CalibratoinData` will be created. Within this, a project directory of the format `YYYYProjectName` will be created in which all the data for the same project and experiment type will be saved as per the previous format.
- Added tool-tip for Dash chart export and play/pause button.
